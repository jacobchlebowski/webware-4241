This project is a "warm-up" exercise. I deployed the starting Web site that I will use this term to Glitch.
This assignment gave me the chance to get myself up to speed on Git,GitHub, and Glitch.
After completing the "base" assignment (warm-up), I went ahead and included **Technical and Design Achievements** (see below).
<br>
<br>



### Technical Achievements
- (5 pts) **HTML Tags**:
I've experimented with a few HTML tags that were unfamiliar to me. Here are the ones I used: <ul>
  <li>1) Used 'a' tag to hyperlink 'WPI'</li> 
  <li>2) Used 'label' tag for labeling progress bar</li>
  <li>3) Used 'progress' tag for make progress bar</li> 
  <li>4) Used 'u' tag to mark misspelled word - "Computtterer"</li>
  <li>5) Used 's' tag to cross out information that is not correct - "500000%"</li> 
</ul>

- (5 pts) **JavaScript Animation**:
I've added a simple JavaScript animation where the h1 tag changes colors between white, yellow, and gray.
 

- (5 pts) **CSS Page Style**:
I've styled my page using CSS by doing the following: <ul>
  <li>1) Marginalized paragraphs and h1 by centering by using "text-align" and "margin"</li>
  <li>2) added border to h1</li>
  <li>3) added background colors to h1,p,h2,h3,ul</li>
  <li>4) changed font of h1 to be in cursive</li>
  <li>5) added background image with "background-image"</li>
</ul>
<br>



### Design Achievements
- (10 pts) **Color Palette**: I used all the colors in my Adobe color palette in my webpage by implementing main.css . This was challenging to me because I haven't dealth with HEX color codes in css before. Furthermore, I've learned to color code each section of index.html (h1, p, h2, h3, and li). Ultimately, I've learned that CSS is great for design when it comes to html visualization. A small screenshot of my color wheel is provided in README.md as well as in my repo. I used 5 colors: <ul>
  <li>color1 = #3A64E0</li>
  <li>color2 = #A8D96C</li>
  <li>color3 = #F7850A</li>
  <li>color4 = #6B67DB</li>
  <li>color5 = #F21C11</li>
</ul>
