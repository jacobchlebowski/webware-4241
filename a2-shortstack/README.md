Welcome to my WebWare assignment 2 project. I took advantage of a CSS grid layout to properly include the header, content, and sidebar. The side bar is where assignments can be added or removed. The header is the title of the webpage. The content is the table which assignments are added or removed from. 

Instructions for adding and removing content: Type in an assignment with respective course and due date and press submit button to add. To remove, type in assignment to remove (case-sensitive!). It is suggested to stay away from duplicate assignments for the sake of less confusion, but removing will delete the earliest duplication first.

Below are the **Technical and Design Achievements**.

## Technical Achievements
- **(10 pts) Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit assignments and always shows the current state of the server-side data. When the user submits data, the server responds by sending back the updated data including the derived due date field and the client updates its data display.

## Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **(5 pts each) Design Achievement 1**:

(5 pts)<b>Last Name: Gregg:</b>

2) Had a problem with inputting date values. Helped me use the type="date" instead of text box. This makes it easier for users to enter dates.

3) I was surprised when they mentioned that they placed a delete button next to all of their added items to their lists. Its different because mine has one single remove button that uses a keyword as opposed to clicking delete ON the actual item.

4) Based on their feedback, I already changed the form for inputting a date. Origianlly, I had the user type it into the text box, but they helped me changed it so it's easier to select a date that's valid as well.


(5 pts)<b>Last Name: Humphrey:</b>

2) Had a problem with the design (UI) of the app. Mentions the header and content (table) isn't centered enough (which I agree with).

3) I was surprised when they told me they liked the ability to duplicate assignments, even though it isn't entirely necessary. The reason they liked it was because if an assignment happened to change a due date, they could make another one and delete the first one respectively the way it works with my application.

4) Based on their feedback, I changed the location of my sidebar (now on the left) and have my content and header lined up with one-another.
