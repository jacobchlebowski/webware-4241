Welcome to my WebWare Assignment 4. This assignment focuses on the same functionality as Assignment 3, but with [React](https://reactjs.org/). React allowed me to use components for the data display as well as updating the page.

Added Components
---

<b> On the Login Page:</b> <br>
1. I've added a `Fun Button` that reacts when clicked. This was my first React component using a `.jsx`, so I kept it simple. This new technology improved the development experience because it allowed me to understand how React works before adding more React components.


2. Also on the login page, I managed to successfully render the login form when the user clicks `Click here to enter information...`. This was an improvement to my development experience because I believe it allows the user to consider if they're signing in, or creating a new account below. Once they know for sure, the form is easily accessible to them.


<b> On the Data/Table Page:</b><br>
1. I've added a React component that renders a different color. Upon clicking the title `My Homework Assignments...click me`, it will change the text color between blue and red, all without reloading the page. This new technology improved the development experience because I learned how to switch between color states in the render function.


2. When removing an assignment under the form `Remove Assignment`, the form now plants a text that states that confirms if the user has removed an assignment or not. This new technology hindered the development exerience becasue Assignment 3 originally automatically reloaded in a seemless transition when removing an assignment. Even though I used React here as part of the assingment in `table_remove.jsx`, it wasn't really necessary.


3. I added a review component on the bottom of the page. This component allows the user to write in a review, and reacts by planting the user's review on the page. This new technology improved the development experience because it was a great way to learn about React in a more advanced way than I had originally intended. This was a completely new component, so I started the html section from scratch for this one, which was fun!
